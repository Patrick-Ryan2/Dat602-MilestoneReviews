-- Dat602 Milestone 3 review


Intro:
For this milestone 3 review the database data objects were linked up a GUI software that being visual studio to show data results from procedures there. 

Project  thoughts:
For each procedure being run through the GUI /Visual studio they were linked wit ha a data access class back to the local sql database and the specific 
procedure targeted  so the procedure could retrieve relevant data and the procedure can operate and return the desired result.

Connecting the GUI to the local database can be tricky and mistakes are more easily made as the GUI code is done in C# as well as the fact 
that it is a relatively new concept to me that is.
This GUI connect ting a databases procedure is incredibly important as it how a GUI interface can be implemented which is the common practice for apps 
being development in the professional world as it is a user-friendly method of interacting with the database system.
For the windows forms which make up the interface on the GUI interface it requires little code and is easy to use using provided tools inside of visual studio 
a user-friendly form for the procedure can be created.
