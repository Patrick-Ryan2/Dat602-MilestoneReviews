# Dat602-MilestoneReviews

Intro:
This review is about milestone 1 initial database design and crud analysis. The purpose of this milestone is to design the database and to create a crud table to figure out how different  procedures will interact with the system to meet their achieved result.
Project thoughts:
First different game ideas and concepts were brainstormed and some sketched onto paper and then when the game idea was chosen that be in Snakes the CRUD table was made. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete)  which are important functions required for a smooth-running reliable data system.
Helpful things:
The crud analysis did help me quite a lot in getting a good understanding of how exactly the different procedures/functions would operate on the database and what attributes/objects they would need to access. It helped me a few times spot errors or missing attributes that adding them made it make more sense.
